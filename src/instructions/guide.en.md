### 1. The Basics: Trade Calculation

Cachy's main function is to calculate your position size and other important metrics based on your risk.

**Step 1: General Inputs**

*   **Long/Short:** Choose the direction of your trade.
*   **Leverage:** Enter the leverage you want to use (e.g., 10 for 10x).
*   **Fees (%):** Enter your exchange's percentage fees (e.g., 0.04 for 0.04%).

**Step 2: Portfolio Inputs**

*   **Account Size:** Enter the total size of your trading account.
*   **Risk/Trade (%):** Define the maximum percentage of your account you want to risk on this single trade (e.g., 1 for 1%).
*   **Risk Amount:** This field displays the calculated monetary amount based on your percentage risk. You can also enter a value directly and lock it.

**Step 3: Trade Setup**

*   **Symbol:** Enter the trading pair (e.g., BTCUSDT). Click the arrow button to load the current price.
*   **Entry Price:** The price at which you open the position.
*   **Stop Loss (SL):** The price at which your position is automatically closed to limit losses.
*   **Use ATR Stop Loss:** Activate this switch to calculate the SL using ATR (Average True Range).
    *   **Manual:** Enter the ATR value and a multiplier manually.
    *   **Auto:** Select a timeframe (e.g., 1h, 4h). The current ATR value is automatically fetched.

Once all these fields are filled in, you will see the results in the right-hand section.

### 2. Understanding the Results

Cachy calculates the following values for you:

*   **Position Size:** The amount of the asset you should buy/sell.
*   **Max Net Loss:** The maximum amount of money you will lose if your stop loss is hit.
*   **Required Margin:** The amount of capital that will be locked for this trade.
*   **Entry Fee:** The estimated fees for opening the position.
*   **Est. Liquidation Price:** An estimate of the price at which your position would be liquidated.
*   **Break Even Price:** The price at which you can close the position without making a profit or loss.

### 3. Defining Take-Profit (TP) Targets

You can set up to 5 take-profit targets to sell parts of your position at specific prices.

*   **Add Target:** Click the **`+`** button to add a new TP row.
*   **Price & Percent:** For each target, enter the price and the percentage of the position to be sold.
*   **Automatic Adjustment:** When you change the percentage of one target, the other (unlocked) targets are automatically adjusted so that the total is always 100%.
*   **Lock Percentage:** Click the lock icon to lock the percentage of a target.

For each valid TP target, you will see a detailed breakdown with metrics such as the **Net Profit** and the **Risk/Reward Ratio (RRR)**.
