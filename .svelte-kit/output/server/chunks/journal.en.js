const journal_en = "# Guide: Trade Journal\n\nThe Trade Journal is your personal logbook for all your trading activities. It helps you track your performance, identify patterns, and continuously improve your strategy.\n\n## 1. Journal Overview\n\nThe main table of the journal shows a chronological list of all your trades.\n\n*   **Date:** The time when the trade was added to the journal.\n*   **Symbol:** The asset traded (e.g., `BTCUSDT`).\n*   **Type:** Whether it was a long or short position.\n*   **Entry:** The entry price of the trade.\n*   **SL (Stop-Loss):** The stop-loss price of the trade.\n*   **R/R (Risk/Reward):** The risk-reward ratio of the trade.\n*   **Status:** The current status of the trade (`Open`, `Won`, `Lost`).\n    *   You can change the status of a trade directly in the table. This is crucial for correct performance analysis.\n*   **Notes:** Personal annotations for the trade.\n    *   Longer notes can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the note cell.\n*   **Action:** Here you will find options such as deleting a trade.\n\n## 2. Search & Filter\n\nAbove the table, you will find functions to organize your trades:\n\n*   **Search Symbol:** Enter a symbol to display only trades of that asset.\n*   **Filter:** Filter trades by their status (`All`, `Open`, `Won`, `Lost`).\n\n## 3. Performance Statistics\n\nAt the top of the journal (or in a separate section), you will find a summary of your performance.\n\n*   **Performance per Symbol:** A detailed breakdown of your performance for each traded symbol.\n    *   **Trades:** The number of trades for this symbol.\n    *   **Profit %:** The percentage of winning trades for this symbol.\n    *   **Total P/L (Profit/Loss):** The cumulative profit or loss for this symbol.\n\n## 4. Data Management\n\nManage your journal data securely and efficiently.\n\n*   **Export (CSV):** Export your entire journal as a CSV file. This serves as a backup or for further analysis in spreadsheet programs.\n*   **Import (CSV):** Import a previously exported CSV file to restore or update your journal. Duplicate entries (based on trade ID) are automatically skipped.\n*   **Clear All:** **Caution!** This action will irrevocably delete your entire journal. Use this function carefully and only if you are sure you want to remove all data.\n";
