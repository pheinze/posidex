const e=`# Guide: Trade Journal

The Trade Journal is your personal logbook for all your trading activities. It helps you track your performance, identify patterns, and continuously improve your strategy.

## 1. Journal Overview

The main table of the journal shows a chronological list of all your trades.

*   **Date:** The time when the trade was added to the journal.
*   **Symbol:** The asset traded (e.g., \`BTCUSDT\`).
*   **Type:** Whether it was a long or short position.
*   **Entry:** The entry price of the trade.
*   **SL (Stop-Loss):** The stop-loss price of the trade.
*   **R/R (Risk/Reward):** The risk-reward ratio of the trade.
*   **Status:** The current status of the trade (\`Open\`, \`Won\`, \`Lost\`).
    *   You can change the status of a trade directly in the table. This is crucial for correct performance analysis.
*   **Notes:** Personal annotations for the trade.
    *   Longer notes can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the note cell.
*   **Action:** Here you will find options such as deleting a trade.

## 2. Search & Filter

Above the table, you will find functions to organize your trades:

*   **Search Symbol:** Enter a symbol to display only trades of that asset.
*   **Filter:** Filter trades by their status (\`All\`, \`Open\`, \`Won\`, \`Lost\`).

## 3. Performance Statistics

At the top of the journal (or in a separate section), you will find a summary of your performance.

*   **Performance per Symbol:** A detailed breakdown of your performance for each traded symbol.
    *   **Trades:** The number of trades for this symbol.
    *   **Profit %:** The percentage of winning trades for this symbol.
    *   **Total P/L (Profit/Loss):** The cumulative profit or loss for this symbol.

## 4. Data Management

Manage your journal data securely and efficiently.

*   **Export (CSV):** Export your entire journal as a CSV file. This serves as a backup or for further analysis in spreadsheet programs.
*   **Import (CSV):** Import a previously exported CSV file to restore or update your journal. Duplicate entries (based on trade ID) are automatically skipped.
*   **Clear All:** **Caution!** This action will irrevocably delete your entire journal. Use this function carefully and only if you are sure you want to remove all data.
